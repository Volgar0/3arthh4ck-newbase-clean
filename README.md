As some people began to see something sussy in the KitCommand newbase phobos i decided to make my own phobos build without .kit command.

Also, i looked up and found nothing sus in the phobus code so i can say its clean and has no rat in it

Anyways, you gotta use it in your own risk of course but it seems to be safe here :)
